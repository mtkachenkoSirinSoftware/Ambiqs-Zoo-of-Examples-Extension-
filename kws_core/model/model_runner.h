// Runtime-agnostic inference facade.

// The concrete backend is chosen at compile time — no vtable, no heap, nothing
// resolved at runtime. Exactly one of these must be defined:
//
//   KWS_RUNTIME_HOST_STUB   host tests. No inference happens; the output tensor
//                           is writable so the quantisation, post-processing and
//                           application paths are still exercised end to end.
//                           This is the default when nothing is defined.
//   KWS_RUNTIME_HELIA_RT    heliaRT (third_party/helia-rt) — Ambiq's LiteRT for
//                           Micro / TFLM runtime, kernels supplied by heliaCORE
//                           (ns-cmsis-nn) via NSX_HELIA_RT_BACKEND=helia.
//                           Consumes the .tflite embedded by tools/embed_model.py.
//   KWS_RUNTIME_EXECUTORCH  nsx-executorch — the NSX adapter for the stock
//                           ExecuTorch Cortex-M runtime. Consumes a .pte, NOT a
//                           .tflite; see docs/runtime_integration.md.
//
// ns-cmsis-nn is deliberately absent from that list: it is a *kernel library*,
// not a runtime (its own README: "Not a model runtime"). It is reached through
// heliaRT's helia backend or through ExecuTorch's CMSIS-NN provider, never
// linked directly by this application.
//
// Backend state is a singleton held inside the backend translation unit: the
// arena, interpreter and model pointer are file-static there, so this class
// stays a thin handle and the header pulls in no runtime headers. The
// application creates exactly one ModelRunner (app/kws_app.cc), which is what
// makes that legitimate.

// it is a ceiling for this r=0.60 pruned model rather than a fit.
//
// What is actually known: linking this model against helia_rt::reference and
// calling AllocateTensors() on the host reports arena_used_bytes() == 12352.
// Arena planning is a property of the graph, not of the CPU, so that number is
// analytically determined rather than measured — but it is a LOWER BOUND, not
// the answer, for two reasons:
//
//   * It was produced by the *reference* kernels, which request no scratch at
//     all (tensorflow/lite/micro/kernels/conv.cc: zero
//     RequestScratchBufferInArena calls). The heliaCORE kernels this firmware
//     actually links request scratch in conv, depthwise_conv and
//     fully_connected (4, 4 and 3 call sites respectively), so the HELIA arena
//     is strictly larger. How much larger is not knowable off-target.
//   * Alignment and head/tail padding differ per toolchain.
//
// So: keep the ceiling until an Apollo510 build reports its own figure, then
// shrink to that plus headroom. The backend logs it at boot
// (ModelRunner::arena_used_bytes(), printed by app/main.cc) and `hpx profile`
// reports it as HPX_ALLOCATED_ARENA. Sizing this from the reference number
// would be a host fact dressed as a target one.
